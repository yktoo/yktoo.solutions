      title: Full-Stack Development
      content: |
          The term means web application development that implements both back-end and front-end technologies. This
          obviously covers a broad variety of disciplines, such as databases, **Go**, **Java**, **Python**, **HTML**,
          **CSS**, Java/TypeScript frameworks, like **Angular** or **React** and everything in between.

      title: Kubernetes and Docker
      content: |
          Containerisation is one of the key technologies in these days. Running software in containers encourages loose
          component coupling, provides isolation and security, enables on-demand up- and down-scaling, and greatly
          facilitates continuous integration. We master **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

      title: Database Development
      content: |
          Relational databases, although being pushed by distributed key-value stores in the last years, are still at
          the core of many applications. We have lots of experience with **Oracle**, **PostgreSQL**, **Sybase**,
          **MySQL**, and **SQLite**.

          And on the NoSQL side with distributed stores such as **MongoDB**, **Tibco Active Spaces** and **Apache Ignite**.

      title: Java
      content: |
          **Java** is a de facto standard for enterprise applications, thanks to its very high adoption rate in the
          corporate environment and myriads of libraries and frameworks. We have many years of experience in Java and
          related topics, such as dependency injection, unit and integration testing, ORM, messaging and many others.

      title: Java/TypeScript & Angular
      content: |
          **Angular** has gained incredible popularity over the last few years. It allows to create highly interactive,
          rich web applications, in a relatively unencumbered way. We have developed a number of web applications that
          use Angular in the front-end, with unit and end-2-end testing.

      title: Python
      content: |
          Python is a very powerful, concise and flexible language used everywhere, from embedded systems to desktop and
          web applications. Our knowledge of **Python** is pretty powerful, too.

      title: Clouds
      content: |
          We love cloudsâ€”that is, the computer ones. We run our numerous services using cloud providers such as **AWS**
          and **Google Cloud Engine**. And we've executed projects that involved automated provisioning and
          Infrastructure-as-Code.

      title: Data Integration (ETL)
      content: |
          Data Integration, also known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), means combining data from different, often
          heterogeneous, sources in a way that provides a unified view on this data. It is typically used for
          integration of different applications and is therefore essential in an enterprise environment.

      title: ... and Many More
      content: |
          It the IT world, new things appear every day. That is why it's impossible to mention every framework or
          component we've worked with. That is why we never stop learning.

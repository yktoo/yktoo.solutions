      title: Full-Stack Development
      content: >-
          The term means web application development that implements both back-end and front-end technologies. This
          obviously covers a broad variety of disciplines, such as databases, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          frameworks, like jQuery and AngularJS and everything in between.

      title: Database Development
      content: >-
          Relational databases, although being pushed by distributed key-value stores in the last years, are still at
          the core of many applications. We have lots of experience with Oracle, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MySQL, and SQLite.
          And on the NoSQL side with distributed stores such as Tibco Active Spaces and Apache Ignite.

      title: Java
      content: >-
          Java is a de facto standard for enterprise applications, thanks to its very high adoption rate in the
          corporate environment and myriads of libraries and frameworks. We have many years of experience in Java and
          related topics, such as dependency injection, unit and integration testing, ORM, messaging and many others.

      title: JavaScript & Angular
      content: >-
          Angular has gained incredible popularity over the last few years. It allows to create highly interactive, rich
          web applications, in a relatively unencumbered way. We have developed a number of web applications that use
          Angular in the front-end, with unit and end-2-end testing.

      title: Python
      content: >-
          Python is a very powerful, concise and flexible language used everywhere, from embedded systems to desktop and
          web applications. Our knowledge of Python is pretty powerful, too.

      title: Clouds
      content: >-
          We love clouds—that is, the computer ones. We run our numerous services using cloud providers such as AWS,
          Scaleway, and Render.com. And we've executed projects that involved automated provisioning and
          Infrastructure-as-Code.

      title: Docker and Friends
      content: >-
          Containerisation is one of the key technologies in these days. Running software in containers encourages loose
          component coupling, provides isolation and security, enables on-demand up- and down-scaling, and greatly
          facilitates continuous integration. We master Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

      title: Data Integration (ETL)
      content: >-
          Data Integration, also known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), means combining data from different, often
          heterogeneous, sources in a way that provides a unified view on this data. It is typically used for
          integration of different applications and is therefore essential in an enterprise environment.

      title: ... and Many More
      content: >-
          It the IT world, new things appear every day. That is why it's impossible to mention every framework or
          component we've worked with. That is why we never stop learning.
